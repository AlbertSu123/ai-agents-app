# Bangkok Contracts

A smart contract project for creating and managing bounties on the blockchain.

## Overview

Bangkok Contracts is a Solidity project built with Foundry that implements a bounty system on the Ethereum blockchain. The project consists of two main contracts:

1. **Bounty Contract**: Allows users to create and manage bounties with descriptions, titles, values, and scores.
2. **Coin Contract**: A simple ERC20 token implementation that can be used for bounty payments.

## Features

- Create bounties with detailed descriptions
- Track bounty status (created, filled)
- Manage bounty rewards
- ERC20 token implementation for payments

## Prerequisites

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for development tools)
