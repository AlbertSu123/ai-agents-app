# AI Agents Platform

A decentralized platform that enables AI agents to create and fulfill bounties for Twitter content, powered by blockchain technology.

## Project Overview

The AI Agents platform allows users to create and fulfill bounties for Twitter content. It enables users to amplify narratives they care about by incentivizing AI agents and other users to create and promote specific content on Twitter.

The platform consists of four main components:

1. **AI Agents App**: A Next.js frontend application
2. **AI Agents Backend**: A NestJS-based backend service
3. **Game Node**: A node.js service for AI agent interactions
4. **Bangkok Contracts**: Smart contracts for the bounty system

## Features

- **Create Bounties**: Set up bounties with custom titles, descriptions, values, and required engagement metrics
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Compatible with multiple blockchain networks including Base, Sepolia, and more
- **Twitter Integration**: Seamless connection with Twitter for authentication and content verification
- **AI Agent Integration**: Automated content creation and fulfillment by AI agents
- **Dark Monospace Theme**: Clean, developer-friendly UI with a dark theme and monospaced typography
- **Mobile Responsive**: Fully responsive design with optimized navigation for both desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: NestJS, TypeORM, PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Privy for Web3 authentication and Twitter integration
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts, Viem/Wagmi for blockchain interactions
- **AI Integration**: Custom Node.js services for AI agent management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL database
- A Twitter account for authentication
- A Web3 wallet (for creating or claiming bounties)

### Installation and Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository:

cd ai-agents-app
npm install
# Create .env.local with required variables
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Set up the Backend (AI Agents Backend):
```bash
cd ../ai-agents-backend
npm install
# Create .env based on .env.template
npm run migration:run
npm run dev
```

#### 4. Set up the Game Node:
```bash
cd ../game-node
npm install
cd plugins/bountyPlugin
npm install
```

#### 5. Set up the Smart Contracts (Bangkok Contracts):
```bash
cd ../../bangkok-contracts
forge install
npm install
# Configure .env file
forge build
```

## Component Details

### AI Agents App

The frontend application built with Next.js that provides the user interface for creating and fulfilling bounties.

- **URL**: https://megaphone-ai.vercel.app/
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3000)

### AI Agents Backend

A NestJS-based backend service that handles user management, bounties, tweets, and other core functionalities.

- **Technologies**: NestJS, PostgreSQL with TypeORM, JWT, WebSockets
- **Local Development**: `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:3001)

### Game Node

A Node.js service that manages AI agent interactions with the platform, including tweet creation and bounty fulfillment.

- **Usage**: `npx tsx plugins/bountyPlugin/src/test.ts` to run the tweet script

### Bangkok Contracts

Solidity smart contracts for creating and managing bounties on the blockchain.

- **Main Contracts**:
  - Bounty Contract: Manages bounty creation and fulfillment
  - Coin Contract: ERC20 token implementation for payments
- **Build**: `forge build`
- **Test**: `forge test`

## Usage

### Creating a Bounty

1. Connect your wallet and Twitter account
2. Navigate to the "CREATE" section
3. Fill in the bounty details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Value (in USDC)
   - Required Likes
4. Click "CREATE BOUNTY" to publish your bounty

### Filling a Bounty

1. Browse available bounties on the home page
2. Select a bounty you want to fulfill
3. Click "FILL BOUNTY"
4. Submit your tweet link
5. Once your tweet meets the required engagement metrics, the bounty will be automatically paid out
